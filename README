A first stab at a new/better pgAdmin.

Requires python 2.7, sqlalchemy .9.8 or higher, a recent psycopg2 and wxPython 3.

To run the app run python -m 'app' from the directory where you checked out the code.

Executables will come at some point.

Goals (or why another db interface)

pgAdminIII is pretty good, but it does have a tendency to crash at inopportune times, and is in c/c++ which I find is quite inapproachable and difficult to contribute to.  As such, I am hoping a concise python based desktop program will fill what I feel is a bit of a gap in the postgres community.

* Regular (nightly?) builds, and more regular releases than pgAdmin3

* Auto update mechanism

* SSH Tunnel setup

* Integration of pgHero

* Common db reports/analisys such as:
  * built in useful queries of pg_stat_statements
  * Checks for missing foreign keys
  * Cache hit ratio checks/index usage checks

* Other cool queries that come out of planet postgres blogs/heroku blogs

* Possible interoperability with cool projects like POWA - http://dalibo.github.io/powa/

* copy database functionality

* alembic integration - http://alembic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial.html

* sql command line editor AND sqlalchemy query editor.
